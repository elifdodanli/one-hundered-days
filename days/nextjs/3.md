# Day 3: Introduction to Next.js

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **What is Next.js?** Learn about the features and benefits of Next.js as a React framework.
2.  **Set Up a New Project:** Use `create-next-app` to bootstrap a new Next.js application.
3.  **Explore the Project Structure:** Familiarize yourself with the default files and directories, especially the `pages` directory.
4.  **Create Your First Page:** Create a new file in the `pages` directory and see how it automatically becomes a route.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Next.js is a powerful framework for building production-ready React applications. It provides features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and file-based routing out of the box. Today, you will create your first Next.js application and learn about its most fundamental feature: file-based routing. Any React component exported from a file in the `pages` directory becomes a route in your application.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will be able to create a new Next.js application and understand its basic structure and routing mechanism. This is the first step to building powerful web applications with Next.js.
