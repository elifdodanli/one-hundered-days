# Day 16: State Management

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand the Need for State Management:** Learn why you might need a global state management solution in a large application.
2.  **Compare State Management Libraries:** Discuss the pros and cons of different libraries like Redux, Zustand, and MobX.
3.  **Implement Zustand:** Learn how to use Zustand, a small, fast, and scalable state management solution.
4.  **Refactor a Component to Use a Global Store:** Replace local component state with state from a global Zustand store.

## 📖 Task Explanations

As your application grows, managing state can become complex. Passing props down through many levels of components (prop drilling) can become cumbersome. Global state management libraries solve this problem by providing a central store for your application's state. Today, you will learn about different state management options and implement a solution using Zustand, a popular and lightweight choice.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

The ability to manage state in a large and complex React application in a clean and scalable way.
