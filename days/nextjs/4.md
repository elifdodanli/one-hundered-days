# Day 4: SSG vs. SSR

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Rendering Strategies:** Learn the difference between Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
2.  **Implement `getStaticProps`:** Create a page that is pre-rendered at build time with data.
3.  **Implement `getServerSideProps`:** Create a page that is rendered on the server for each request.
4.  **Discuss When to Use Each:** Understand the trade-offs and decide which rendering strategy is appropriate for different use cases.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Next.js offers different rendering strategies to optimize your application for performance and SEO. With Static Site Generation (SSG), the HTML is generated at build time and can be served from a CDN, making it incredibly fast. With Server-Side Rendering (SSR), the HTML is generated on the server for each request, which is useful for pages with frequently changing data. Today, you will learn how to implement both using `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

A deep understanding of the different rendering methods available in Next.js, allowing you to build highly optimized and performant applications.
