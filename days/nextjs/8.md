4.  **Submit Data to an API Route:** Make a POST request from your form submission handler to an API route to save the data.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Forms are a fundamental part of most web applications. Today, you will learn how to build forms in React and Next.js. You will learn how to create controlled components by managing the form's input values in the component's state. You will then learn how to handle the submission of the form, sending the data to a backend API route that you created.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

The ability to create forms and handle user input in your Next.js applications, a critical skill for building interactive web experiences.
