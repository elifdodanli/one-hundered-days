# Day 6: API Routes

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand API Routes:** Learn how to create a backend for your Next.js application using API Routes.
2.  **Create Your First API Route:** Create a file in the `pages/api` directory to define an API endpoint.
3.  **Handle Different HTTP Methods:** Learn how to handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests in a single API route.
4.  **Fetch Data from Your API:** Call your new API route from a frontend component.

## 📖 Task Explanations

API Routes allow you to easily create a backend for your Next.js application. Any file inside the `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*` and will be treated as an API endpoint instead of a page. This allows you to build full-stack applications within a single Next.js project. Today, you will create your first API route and learn how to handle different types of requests.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

The ability to build a full-stack application with both a frontend and a backend using only Next.js.
