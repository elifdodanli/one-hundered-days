## 📖 Task Explanations

Once a user is authenticated, you need to control what they can see and do. Today, you will learn how to protect pages and API routes in your Next.js application using NextAuth.js. You will learn how to check if a user is logged in and redirect them if they are not. This is essential for building applications with user-specific content and functionality.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will be able to build secure applications by protecting your pages and APIs from unauthorized access.
