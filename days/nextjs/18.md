# Day 18: End-to-End Testing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand E2E Testing:** Learn the difference between unit testing and end-to-end (E2E) testing.
2.  **Set Up Cypress:** Add Cypress, a popular E2E testing framework, to your Next.js project.
3.  **Write Your First E2E Test:** Write a test that simulates a user navigating through your application.
4.  **Test a Full User Flow:** Write a test that covers a complete user journey, such as signing up, creating a post, and then deleting it.

## 📖 Task Explanations

End-to-end (E2E) tests are designed to test your application as a whole, from the user's perspective. They simulate real user interactions in a browser, giving you the highest level of confidence that your application is working correctly. Today, you will learn how to use Cypress to write E2E tests for your Next.js application, ensuring that your key user flows are always working as expected.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

The ability to write comprehensive E2E tests for your applications, ensuring that your most critical user journeys are free of bugs.
