# Day 7: Client-Side Data Fetching

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Client-Side Fetching:** Learn when it is appropriate to fetch data on the client-side versus using SSG or SSR.
2.  **Fetch Data with `useEffect`:** Use the `useEffect` Hook to fetch data from an API when a component mounts.
3.  **Introduction to SWR:** Learn about SWR, a React Hooks library for data fetching created by Vercel.
4.  **Refactor to Use SWR:** Replace your `useEffect` data fetching logic with the `useSWR` Hook for a more robust solution.

## 📖 Task Explanations

While `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` are great for initial page loads, you will often need to fetch data on the client-side in response to user interactions. Today, you will learn how to do this, first with the standard `useEffect` Hook and then with SWR. SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) is a powerful library that provides caching, revalidation, and many other features out of the box, making your client-side data fetching much more efficient.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will be able to fetch data from the client-side in your Next.js applications and understand the benefits of using a dedicated data fetching library like SWR.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Client-Side Data Fetching:** The process of fetching data from an API in the browser after the initial page load.
*   **SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate):** A strategy to first return the data from cache (stale), then send the fetch request (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data.
*   **`useSWR`:** The primary Hook provided by the SWR library for fetching data.
