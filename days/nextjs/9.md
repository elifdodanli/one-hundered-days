# Day 9: Connecting to a Database with Prisma

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **What is Prisma?** Learn about Prisma, a modern database toolkit that makes it easy to work with databases.
2.  **Set Up Prisma:** Add Prisma to your Next.js project and configure it to connect to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite).
3.  **Define Your Schema:** Use the Prisma schema language to define your database models.
4.  **Use Prisma Client in an API Route:** Use the auto-generated Prisma Client to read from and write to your database inside an API route.

## 📖 Task Explanations

To build a true full-stack application, you need a database. Today, you will learn how to use Prisma, a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), to connect your Next.js application to a database. You will define your data models in the Prisma schema, and Prisma will automatically generate a type-safe client that you can use to interact with your database. This makes working with databases in your API routes simple and safe.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will be able to connect your Next.js application to a database, allowing you to build applications that can persist data.
